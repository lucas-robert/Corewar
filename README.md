# Corewar

This repo is dedicated to a custom Corewar implementation, working in C.

## What is Corewar?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_War) states that "Core War is a 1984 programming game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in which two or more battle programs (called "warriors") compete for control of a virtual computer. These battle programs are written in an abstract assembly language called RedCode."




## Project overview
This project is splitted in two parts:
* Assembler
* Virtual Machine


### Assembler
Implementation of a RedCode compiler. Support a custom assembly language, detailed in Assembler's `README.md`

### Virtual machine
Implementation of a virtual machine capable of reading and interpreting RedCode.
The virtual machine offers a graphical user interface, powered by Ncurses.
